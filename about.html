      <h5 class="overline">Who am I?</h5>
      <h2>I'm a multidisciplinary designer with a passion in graphic and software design. I'm currently designing product experiences, full-time at Accenture and working side gigs with tech startups in silicon valley</h2>

    <h3>Learner</h3></br>
    <p>I love learning new skills. I'm a strong believer in learning at all ages. There are no limits and we're never late to learn anything new and that's exactly what I did during Covid. I started coding my own website (this portfolio). I believe this way I can better understand software in general, make better design decisions and provide more compelling arguments when working with engineers. I'm currently working with HTML, CSS, Saas, JS, jQuery some other library and frameworks.</p>
  </div>


  <div>
    <h3>Designer</h3></br>
    <p>In college, I designed websites and presentations for professors, term projects and classmates. However I wasn't aware this could be my career someday. I simply enjoyed making things. Today I realize how design can be a very powerful tool in shaping our everyday lives. I really enjoy creating aesthetic and functional solutions to modern issues. I believe through design and technology we can help humans better navigate through modern challenges.</p>
  </div>


  <div>
    <h3>Techie</h3></br>
    <p>I'm an absolute fan of how technology helps us simplify our daily lives. I also believe it harbours endless possibilities for shaping our future. About hundred and fifty years ago a scientist by the name of <span>Dr. Zamenhof</span> imagined creating a common language for all of mankind believing this would avoid all wars. He even founded a language called <span>Esperanto</span>, still valid today, to address the problem. Today we have a real shot at making this a reality through language tech.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Family</h3></br>
    <p>Spending time with my wife and kids is one of my favorite activities. I am a father of two and most of my leisure activities involve playing with kids and spending time with my family. I'm gonna be honest, I still play Lego and other kid's games including video games and I really enjoy dping it. As a family, we enjoy taking road trips, exploring cafes, restaurants, new sights, as well as playing sports, spending time outdoors and with other family members.</p>
